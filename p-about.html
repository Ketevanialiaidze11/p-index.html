		<p class="black">Hello, I am Kate. This is a blog that I like to do as a hobby to share little pieces of my life and about the things in life that I love and interest me. I love creating being inspired to create a beautiful and sophisticated lifestyle in all areas of my life including work, home, style, health and food. I approach all things in life as a less is more and quality is better than quantity kind of mindset. You will find that I love things with a timeless allure, especially the French lifestyle. I have been a Francophile for over eight years and have enjoyed reading many books on their life and style. I constantly indulge in all things French including books, movies, music, beauty, food and style.

			On any given day you may fid me at home cozied up with a book, or at a coffee shop or trying a new restaurant or even out shopping at a vintage store. Some simple things that I love: to go to the cinema and enjoy a good film, French artisan soaps and candles, curating a capsule wardrobe that I adore, traveling near and far, being out in nature whether in the mountains or at the beach, delicious foods, shopping, a good coffee and a luxurious weekend at home.

			Come follow along as I share parts of my life, some sophisticated living ideas and all the things that I enjoy. </p>

		<p>You probably have a bucket list–a list of life goals that you want to achieve before you “kick the bucket”; or, at the very least, you’re thinking of making one.

			In addition, your bucket list almost certainly contains a lot of travel goals. If that’s the case, you’ve come to the right place. This post will show you how to achieve your travel goals.
			There are some things in this life that just holds a timeless allure for me. It is those things that no matter how many times I experience it, I still want more. I create my life around these things and indulge in them as much as I can. One of these things for me is traveling. Travelling leaves me speechless at that time and then days later turns me into an avid story teller. I have made some of my most cherished memories while traveling. Memories that I will carry with me always and that I will one day look back on one day as proof that while I was alive I did indeed live life to the fullest for myself.

			For me, travelling is not about being a tourist. I do not want to plan out every minute of my time and see only the “tourist traps” of the destination. While it is nice to see these familiar landmarks I mostly like to wander around and find things organically. I like to see things that are going to surprise and delight me and to interact with the people who live there. The French call this Flaneur, it means to walk the city (or anyplace really) with no set destination just see what you may find or experience. There is no hurry, no agenda and no scheduled timeframe. This is my favorite way to experience a new place when I travel. I often find that not only do I run into famous landmarks anyways, but that I often find something just as awe inspiring that is not a famous landmark.</p>

		<p>Street Fashion is exactly what it means. It is fashion that has evolved from the streets and not from runway shows or designers. It really has its grassroots in the youth culture of the recent decades. Street fashion, unlike other fashions, does not cover just one style.
			Street style has always existed but it has become a phenomenon of 20th century. The increase in the standardization of life after World War II (Suburbanization, Mass marketing, the spread of television) may be linked to the appeal of "alternative" lifestyles for individuals in search of “identity”. Industrial production, particularly in the sphere of fashion, was not only the popularization of stylists’ tastes that move from high fashion, through pre`t-a`-porter, to the peripheries of the system. These were also tastes that originated among economically disfavored, marginal groups, the whole range of metropolitan tribes, that are able to trigger new fashion production and diffusion processes.
			Street style is an incredibly viral, instant, addictive facet of fashion that has changed many of the ways in which fashion is made and consumed. Its fast characteristic links it also to the term consumerism.[2] Given how styles change over time, it also challenges the use of “fast fashion” in relation to the purchasing and wearing of clothing, as this conceals the complexities of practice.</p>

		<p>Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. “Stress can reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate,” says Dr. Nevins. “Yoga can be very effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.”
			Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being. “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, “because they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.”</p>
