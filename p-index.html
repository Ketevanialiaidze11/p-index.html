	<h1>THE TIMELESS ALLURE OF TRAVEL</h1>

		<p>You probably have a bucket list–a list of life goals that you want to achieve before you “kick the bucket”; or, at the very least, you’re thinking of making one.

			In addition, your bucket list almost certainly contains a lot of travel goals. If that’s the case, you’ve come to the right place. This post will show you how to achieve your travel goals.
			There are some things in this life that just holds a timeless allure for me. It is those things that no matter how many times I experience it, I still want more. I create my life around these things and indulge in them as much as I can. One of these things for me is traveling. Travelling leaves me speechless at that time and then days later turns me into an avid story teller. I have made some of my most cherished memories while traveling. Memories that I will carry with me always and that I will one day look back on one day as proof that while I was alive I did indeed live life to the fullest for myself.

				<p>Street Fashion is exactly what it means. It is fashion that has evolved from the streets and not from runway shows or designers. It really has its grassroots in the youth culture of the recent decades. Street fashion, unlike other fashions, does not cover just one style.
					Street style has always existed but it has become a phenomenon of 20th century. The increase in the standardization of life after World War II (Suburbanization, Mass marketing, the spread of television) may be linked to the appeal of "alternative" lifestyles for individuals in search of “identity”. Industrial production, particularly in the sphere of fashion, was not only the popularization of stylists’ tastes that move from high fashion, through pre`t-a`-porter, to the peripheries of the system. These were also tastes that originated among economically disfavored, marginal groups, the whole range of metropolitan tribes, that are able to trigger new fashion production and diffusion processes.
					Street style is an incredibly viral, instant, addictive facet of fashion that has changed many of the ways in which fashion is made and consumed.

			<h4>YOGA</h4>

			<div class="containerr">
				<div class="c50" style="background: url(assets/img/yoga.jpg);background-size:cover; background-position: center center; min-height: 300px; width:560px"></div>

					<p>Aside from the physical benefits, one of the best benefits of yoga is how it helps a person manage stress, which is known to have devastating effects on the body and mind. “Stress can reveal itself in many ways, including back or neck pain, sleeping problems, headaches, drug abuse, and an inability to concentrate,” says Dr. Nevins. “Yoga can be very effective in developing coping skills and reaching a more positive outlook on life.”
						Yoga’s incorporation of meditation and breathing can help improve a person’s mental well-being. “Regular yoga practice creates mental clarity and calmness; increases body awareness; relieves chronic stress patterns; relaxes the mind; centers attention; and sharpens concentration,” says Dr. Nevins. Body- and self-awareness are particularly beneficial, she adds, “because they can help with early detection of physical problems and allow for early preventive action.”</p>
